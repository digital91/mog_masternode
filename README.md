How to use MOGWAI Masternode script

Shell script to install a MOGWAI Masternode on a Linux server running Ubuntu 16.04. Use it on your own risk.

I highly recommend to use Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Installation
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digital91/mog_masternode/master/mog.sh
chmod +x mog.sh
./mog.sh
If you see your Masternode IP, Masternode PORT and Masternode ID. It mean you completed configuration your server. Check again with option 3 in script. Showing Active in green means masternode service working.

Go to Roller CMS to submit your masternode.
